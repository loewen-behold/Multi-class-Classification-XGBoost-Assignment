# Multi-class-Classification-XGBoost-Assignment

My notebook is included, but I believe something went wrong with the submission csv I uploaded to kaggle because the score was 24.87992.  Or my model was just that poor.  However, when I checked the log loss score of my model it was 3.40.  I've run out of time to troubleshoot further.
